## Grading Criteria:

### The general grading criteria and their weights are listed below. 
### This list is a guideline; some MPs - most prominently MP1 - will deviate from this list.
    Code compiles: 35% (This basically means that you should get at least 35% for each machine problem)
    Feature completeness and functional correctness: 20%
    Code documentation, including regular and documented github commits: 15%
    Definition and implementation of appropriate and convincing test suite: 10%
    Report 20%
    Grand Total: 100%


## Turnin suggestions for Machine Problems:

    Follow a consistent code formatting style. This will ensure that the TA spends most of his time in understanding the logic of your code rather than on the structure of your code.
    Handle error conditions well. Try your best to make sure that your code prints out relevant progress messages on the console, so that the TA can figure how far along your code progressed in case the code crashes.
    Pay attention to efficiency. Although the grading criteria includes only 10 points for it, efficiency is important. It is best to cultivate this habit sooner rather than later. Thinking about efficiency will also help you in writing a better report (20 points) by reasoning for/against design decisions.
    Before submission, make sure to check that your code compiles. To make sure that you have submitted the correct version of your code, download the submitted version from the submission page and recompile it on top of a clean version of the any provided bare bones code. This will ensure that you will not lose out on any of the 35% for correct compilations. In the past we have seen students losing points because of code compilation issues.
